## Exercise 4 (haven't finished yet)


## Exercise 27 Remove Element
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums *in-place*. The relative order of the elements may be changed.


### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
题目想要的是同时还删除一个array 中所有的 val 并且返回array 的前*k *个数据（重要)。

···
Class Solution
{
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
		//定义两个指针，fast 指针用于遍历整个array，slow 指针用于把array 替换非val的数据。
		//假如
	}	
}

```
